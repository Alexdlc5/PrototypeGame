# Prototype_Game
My second-semester project for the HS Advanced Programming Topics course.

Description:
 Third-person rogue-type shooter where you wobble from side to side when moving.
 
Progress:
 - "Infinite" world generation with multiple biomes.
 - Different enemy types with different behavior.
 - Interactive world objects.
 - Power upgrades.
 - Overall complete gameplay loop and progression that spans over multiple rounds.
 - Fixed the camera bug.

TODO:
- Add a tutorial or some kind of instruction on how to play.
- Add textures.
- Polish enemy behavior.
- Game saves.
- Tile loading queue 
	-world origin holds a queue that loads tiles one by one 
	 -tile generator waits for the queue to generate or maybe just waits to generate props
