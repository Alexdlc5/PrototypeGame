# Prototype_Game
My second-semester project for the HS Advanced Programming Topics course.

Description:
 Third-person rogue-type shooter where you wobble from side to side when moving.
 
Progress:
 - "Infinite" world generation with multiple biomes.
 - Different enemy types with different behavior.
 - Interactive world objects.
 - Power upgrades.
 - Overall complete gameplay loop and progression that spans over multiple rounds.

TODO:
- Fix the camera bug.
- Add a tutorial or some kind of instruction on how to play.
- Add better(or maybe simpler) textures.
- Polish enemy behavior
- Game saves
